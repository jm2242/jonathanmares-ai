Welcome to my newly redesigned website! I've rebuilt this one with Cursor to test out AI driven development. The original site is at jolly-knuth-183ee2.netlify.app.

## What's New

This new version of the site is built with:

- **Next.js 16** - The React framework for production
- **TypeScript** - For better code quality and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - For modern, responsive styling
- **Markdown-based blog** - Simple content management that works with git

## What's Coming

I'll be writing about:

- **Music** - I'm spending more time playing both classical and jazz piano

Stay tuned for more content!
