excerpt: A fresh start with Next.js, TypeScript, and modern web technologies.
---

Welcome to my newly redesigned website! I've completely rebuilt this site from scratch using modern web technologies to create a better experience for both me (as the content creator) and you (as the reader).

## What's New

This new version of the site is built with:

- **Next.js 16** - The React framework for production
- **TypeScript** - For better code quality and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - For modern, responsive styling
- **Markdown-based blog** - Simple content management that works with git

## Why the Change?

My previous site was built 4-5 years ago, and while it served its purpose, the UI/UX was getting outdated. This was also a great opportunity to learn about the latest web development tools and practices.

## What's Coming

I'll be writing about:

- **Software Engineering** - Architecture, best practices, and lessons learned
- **Computer Science** - Algorithms, data structures, and technical deep-dives
- **Motorcycles** - Adventure riding, bike maintenance, and travel stories

Stay tuned for more content!
